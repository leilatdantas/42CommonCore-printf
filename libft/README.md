# libft - Your Personal Library of Awesome Functions! :books:
### Welcome to my libft project at 42 School! :wave:

This project was part of the Common Core curriculum and challenged me to create my own library of awesome functions in C. It was a lot of hard work, but also a lot of fun! :muscle:

### What is libft? ðŸš€
Libft is a personal library of useful functions that you can use in your future C projects. It includes everything from basic string and memory functions to more advanced data structures like linked lists and binary trees. Think of it as your own personal toolbox for coding in C! :toolbox:

### How to Use libft ðŸ’¡
To use libft in your project, simply include the library header file in your code and link your program to the compiled library file. Then, you can call any of the functions in the library just like you would with any other C library function.

#### What's in the Library?
The libft library contains a wide range of functions to make your life easier when coding in C. Here are just a few of the functions included:

**ft_strlen:** Calculates the length of a string.  
**ft_strcpy:** Copies a string from one location to another.  
**ft_atoi:** Converts a string to an integer.  
**ft_memset:** Sets a block of memory to a specified value.  
**ft_bzero:** Sets a block of memory to zero.  
**ft_lstadd_back:** Adds a new node at the end of a linked list.  

### Conclusion ðŸŽ‰
Libft is a challenging and rewarding project that is helping me develop my skills in C programming and data structures. It's also a useful resource that I can use in my future projects. If you're a fellow 42 student, I hope this README gives you an idea of what to expect from the project. And if you're a C programmer looking for a useful library of functions, give libft a try!
